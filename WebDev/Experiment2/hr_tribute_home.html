        <h2>About</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Hans Rosling (27 July 1948 - 7 February 2017) was a Swedish physician, academic and public speaker. 
                He was a professor of international health at Karolinska Institute and was the co-founder and chairman of the Gapminder Foundation, which developed the Trendalyzer software system. 
                He held presentations around the world, including several TED Talks in which he promoted the use of data (and data visualization) to explore development issues. 
                His posthumously published book Factfulness, coauthored with his daughter-in-law Anna Rosling Rönnlund and son Ola Rosling, became an international bestseller.
